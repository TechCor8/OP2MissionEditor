# OP2MissionEditor
 Mission Editor for Outpost 2
 
### Download
You can download the mission editor from the release page.

[Mission Editor Releases](https://github.com/TechCor8/OP2MissionEditor/releases)

### Required Redistributables:

If the editor will not run, you may need the Visual C++ 2019 redistributable.

[vc_redist.x86](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)

If you can create missions just fine, but the game crashes when you try to start it in the game, you may need the .NET Framework Runtime.

[.NET Framework 4.7.2 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)

## Linux Users

The editor should work "out of the box". Make sure you turn on the run permission for the .x86_64 file.

You must install the .NET Framework with Wine Tricks to get missions to run in the game.
